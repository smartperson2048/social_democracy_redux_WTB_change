= Fall of the [? if chancellor == "Marx" : Marx IV ?][? if chancellor == "Brüning" : Brüning II ?] Government

The cabinet of [? if chancellor == "Marx" : Wilhelm Marx ?][? if chancellor == "Brüning" : Heinrich Brüning ?] has finally collapsed in a dispute over school law, with the coalition unable to agree on one due to the concerns of the DVP's more secular wing.

As a result, the Reichstag has been dissolved for new elections for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].
